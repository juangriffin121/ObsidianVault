>It is almost always preferable to have at least a little bit of regularization, so generally you should avoid plain linear regression. Ridge is a good default, but if you suspect that only a few features are useful, you should prefer lasso or elastic net because they tend to reduce the useless featuresâ€™ weights down to zero, as discussed earlier. In general, elastic net is preferred over
