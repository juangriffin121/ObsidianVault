Finally, some estimators, given a dataset, are capable of making predictions; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model in the previous chapter was a predictor: given a countryâ€™s GDP per capita, it predicted life satisfaction. A predictor has a predict() method that takes a dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It also has a score() method that measures the quality of the predictions, given a test set (and the corresponding labels, in the case of supervised learning algorithms).
