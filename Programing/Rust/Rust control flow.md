```rust
if condition {
	code_if_true
} else {
	code_if_false
}
```

```rust
let number = 6;

if number % 4 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 4");
} else if number % 3 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 3");
} else if number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 2");
} else {
    println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
}
```
When this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition evaluates to `true`. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don’t see the output `number is divisible by 2`, nor do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the `else` block. That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first `true` condition, and once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.
