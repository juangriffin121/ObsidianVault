The stack is a memory thing which is used by adding and taking from its last place, stack of plates. LIFO.
The heap is a memory that allows growing the data in length but can only be accessed through a pointer and thus is generally slower to access, and when copying its contents it also takes longer.

Things in the heap are usually dealt with in rust by [[Borrow]]
