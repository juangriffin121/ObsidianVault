Idempotence: AA = A A + A = A
Commutativity: AB = B A A + B = B + A 
Associativity: A(BC) = (AB)C = ABC A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C = A + B + C 
Distributivity: A(B + C) = AB + AC A + (BC) = (A + B)(A + C) 
Duality: If C = AB, then C = A + B If D = A + B, then D = A B

The proposition A ⇒ B (1.14) to be read as ‘A implies B’, does not assert that either A or B is true; it means only that A B is false, or, what is the same thing, (A + B) is true. This can be written also as the logical equation A = AB. That is, given (1.14), if A is true then B must be true; or, if B is false then A must be false
