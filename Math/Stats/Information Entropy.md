If I can ask n yes or no questions about M objects separated into groups and theres $k_i$ objects in the i'th group, then the probability of a random object picked up of being part of the i'th group $p_i$ is $\frac {k_i}{M}$ 
$H(p) = E(\log(p)) = \sum \limits _x p(x)\log(\frac {1}{p(x)}) = -\sum p(x)\log(p(x))$
