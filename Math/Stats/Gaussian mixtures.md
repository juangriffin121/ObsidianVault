A gaussian mixture model is a model for a random variable distribution that assumes that the distribution is a sum of n different gaussian distributions with different means, variance and density (the percentage of 1 the integral of each gaussian represents).

$$f(X,\theta) = \sum_i \alpha_i \frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi} \sigma_i} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{X-\mu_i}{\sigma_i})^2}$$where $\theta_i = (\alpha_i, \mu_i, \sigma_i)$ and $\sum \limits_i \alpha_i = 1$
