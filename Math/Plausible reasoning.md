Weak syllogisms:
	if A is true, then B is true B is true (1.3) therefore, A becomes more plausible.
	If A is true, then B is true A is false (1.4) therefore, B becomes less plausible.
	If A is true, then B becomes more plausible B is true (1.5) therefore, A becomes more plausible
	This last one is: If evidence, then data becomes more plausible, evidence, therefore data becomes more plausible
Prior information:
	in our reasoning we depend very much on prior information to help us in evaluating the degree of plausibility in a new problem. This reasoning process goes on unconsciously, almost instantaneously, and we conceal how complicated it really is by calling it common sense.

To emphasize this, instead of asking, ‘How can we build a mathematical model of human common sense?’, let us ask, ‘How could we build a machine which would carry out useful plausible reasoning, following clearly defined principles expressing an idealized common sense?
