Measure of overfitting of polinomial regressions.
"are plots of the modelâ€™s training error and validation error as a function of the training iteration: just evaluate the model at regular intervals during training on both the training set and the validation set, and plot the results. If the model cannot be trained incrementally (i.e., if it does not support partial_fit() or warm_start), then you must train it several times on gradually larger subsets of the training set"

curves:
	training_set error vs training_set size
	validation_set error vs training_set size

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve
train_sizes, train_scores, valid_scores = learning_curve(
LinearRegression(), X, y, train_sizes=np.linspace(0.01, 1.0, 40), cv=5,
scoring="neg_root_mean_squared_error")
train_errors = -train_scores.mean(axis=1) #Averaged over the cv_splits
valid_errors = -valid_scores.mean(axis=1)
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_errors, "r-+", linewidth=2, label="train")
plt.plot(train_sizes, valid_errors, "b-", linewidth=3, label="valid")
[...] # beautify the figure: add labels, axis, grid, and legend
plt.show()
