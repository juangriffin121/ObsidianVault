`git init` 
`git status`
`git add file`
`git commit`
`git add remote git@github:juangriffin121/reponame.git`
if i put it with https it will ask me for password or PAT which is trash with the new url its better with ssh and if i have it done i can just push, if i had the https one i can change it like this
`git remote set url git@github:juangriffin121/reponame.git`
i can see if its the previous one like this:
`git remote -v`
`git push -u origin main|master`
