package and project manager for rust, works as [[poetry]] for python.
```bash
$ cargo new project_name
```

```
project_name
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
	└── main.rs
```

```bash
$ cargo new --lib project_name
```

```
project_name
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
	└── lib.rs
```

`cargo build` compiles the code `cargo test` tests and `cargo run` runs it
