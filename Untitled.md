Yes, there is a formula for the Laplace transform of a composition of functions. It is known as the "First Shifting Theorem" and states that the Laplace transform of a function composed with another function is equal to the product of the Laplace transforms of the individual functions, multiplied by the variable s and shifted by the argument of the composition.$$L(f(g(t))) = L(f(s)) \cdot L(g(t))$$where $f(g(t))$ is the composed function, $L(f(s))$ is the Laplace transform of the outer function, and $L(g(t))$ is the Laplace transform of the inner function.Please note that this is a simplified version and the actual formula may change depending on the specific functions being used. If you are looking for more information or a specific example, I would recommend consulting a textbook or a professional on the topic.
